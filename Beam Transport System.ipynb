    "## Solenoid Focusing\n",
    "A common technique for radially focusing low energy electron beams is to use a solenoid.  The electron beam enters the solenoid with a radius $r_0$, and comes out with a smaller radius $r_1$, where $r_1 < r_0$.  Lets explore how this works!"

    "\n",
    "Lets assume we have a beam with zero thermal emittance - that is, all particles come off the cathode with some longitudinal velocity $v_z$, and that $v_x$ and $v_y$ are zero.  This isn't really true, but its not too far off: the beam is being accelerated along the z axis, so $v_z >> v_x$ and $v_z >> v_y$.  Lets also assume that there's no space charge, i.e. the electrons don't repel each other (this isn't true either, but it will make the discussion much simpler.  We can talk about how space charge modifies things later.)"
